# Seasons App


## App Description
Season app is simple, in that a screen with a message will be loaded depending on what season you are currently in. To get the season we used the [Geolocation API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) along with some conditional statements that derived the season whether you are in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. That is all!

## Learning Objectives and Outcomes
* Learned how to bootstrap a React App using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app) and do initial configuration.
* First look at [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html), the syntax extension to JavaScript used in React.
* Introduced to the **Props** system in React, with a good overview of how they work and how to structure and pass props.
* First introduction to **Functional** and **Class Based** components.
* An introduction to **State** in React Components
* And finally a very good introduction to the difficult topic of **Lifecycle Methods** in React.

### Other Season App Info
- We used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) for the user interface and styling of the app.
- The Geolocation API was a first for me, as I had not known it existed and now will try to use it more often.

### Quick Reflection
I feel this course by Stephen Grider truly is the best introduction to React I have seen yet. I worked through part of the Udacity React content, and felt confused and pretty much lost, particularly on the project that was used as the final application required on the Front End Developer NanoDegree. But already in the very first mini application of this course, I feel already more confident in my understanding of the very basics of React as I ever have up until now.
