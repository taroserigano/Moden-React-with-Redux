# Weather, a React-Redux's Sample  

This is a simple web SPA which demonstrate the basic parts of React-Redux such as Reducers, Action, Action creator and also these new things: 

- Action creator for calling API Backend (OpenWeather API) & defined the Action's type as constant.
- Calling API through using axios library.
- Using specific redux middleware (redux-promise) for handling Promise object (returned from calling axios's get method) into resolved data and assign the resolved data into the action's payload, automatically.
- Handling state in reducer by not mutating the state. Instead, we create a new state which takes prior state's data and also current data.
- Displaying a series of data in a line chart through using components in react-sparklines library.
- Displaying location-type data in a mini google map through using components in react-google-maps library.
- Refactoring duplicated markups by moving these markup into a component (WeatherList component) so that the markups can be shared in other area within application.


###Known issues:###

- Current implementation does not support responsive layout. 
- Returned Error from calling API Backend has not been shown on screen yet.
- Refreshing the result can only be made through refreshing the page.
